### ✅ B) Temporal Worker & Wiring → RESOLVED
**Status:** Complete
**Locations:** 
- `workflows/leave_approval.py` - Complete leave approval workflow implementation
- `workflows/worker.py` - Temporal worker configuration with proper imports
**Details:**
- Removed duplicate/incomplete workflow directories (`workflows/leave_approval/`, `workflows/onboarding/`)
- Unified workflow implementation in `workflows/leave_approval.py` with no incomplete blocks
- Worker properly imports all required symbols: `LeaveApprovalWorkflow`, `verify_balance`, `request_manager_approval`, `record_decision`, `notify_employee`
- Ready for Temporal service integration

### ✅ C) Alembic Migrations → RESOLVED
**Status:** Complete
**Locations:**
- `services/attendance-svc/migrations/versions/001_initial_migration.py`
- `services/leave-svc/migrations/versions/001_initial_migration.py`
**Details:**
- Initial migration files created for both attendance and leave services
- Attendance service: Creates `shifts` and `attendance_summaries` tables with proper indices
- Leave service: Creates `leave_types`, `leave_balances`, and `leave_requests` tables with relationships
- Makefile targets added: `attendance.db.revision`, `attendance.db.upgrade`, `leave.db.revision`, `leave.db.upgrade`

### ✅ D) JWT Dependencies → VERIFIED COMPLETE
**Status:** Complete
**Location:** `libs/py-hrms-auth/src/py_hrms_auth/jwt_dep.py`
**Details:**
- Complete JWT authentication implementation with JWKS cache
- Proper issuer/audience/JWKS URL configuration
- Role-based and scope-based access control dependencies
- Tenant context integration
- Error handling and security best practices

### ✅ E) Celery Task Modules → RESOLVED
**Status:** Complete
**Locations:**
- `services/auth-svc/app/tasks.py`
- `services/employee-svc/app/tasks.py`
- `services/attendance-svc/app/tasks.py`
- `services/leave-svc/app/tasks.py`
**Details:**
- Task files created for all services that require background processing
- Proper Celery configuration with Redis broker
- Sample tasks and notification tasks implemented
- Ready for service-specific task implementation

### ✅ F) Additional Fixes Applied
**Status:** Complete
**Details:**
- Fixed TOML parsing errors in `pyproject.toml` files
- Corrected import statements for FastAPI middleware (starlette vs fastapi)
- Fixed TenantDatabaseManager initialization parameters
- Added proper Alembic configuration with logging setup

## Technical Architecture Verified

### Core Components
1. **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions workflow with comprehensive testing and security scanning
2. **Temporal Workflows**: Leave approval workflow with proper activity definitions
3. **Database Migrations**: Alembic setup for attendance and leave services
4. **Authentication**: JWT-based auth with role/scope management
5. **Background Tasks**: Celery integration for asynchronous processing

### Service Architecture
- **auth-svc**: Authentication and authorization service
- **employee-svc**: Employee management service  
- **attendance-svc**: Time tracking and attendance management
- **leave-svc**: Leave request and approval management
- **agents-gateway**: AI agent integration service
- **workflows**: Temporal workflow orchestration

### Infrastructure Components
- **Kong Gateway**: API gateway with routing and CORS
- **Keycloak**: Identity and access management
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database with multi-tenant support
- **Redis**: Caching and Celery broker
- **Temporal**: Workflow orchestration engine

## Next Steps Recommendation

The platform is now ready to proceed with items D-I as outlined in the original roadmap:

- **D**: Celery reliability & RabbitMQ posture
- **E**: Security hardening (router-level auth, RBAC, audit logs)
- **F**: Observability (OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Grafana, Loki)
- **G**: Tenancy & data isolation (schema-per-tenant, RLS)
- **H**: Agents Gateway (ADK-ready endpoints, rate limits)
- **I**: Production ops (secrets management, TLS, monitoring)

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `services/attendance-svc/migrations/versions/001_initial_migration.py`
- `services/leave-svc/migrations/versions/001_initial_migration.py`
- `services/auth-svc/app/tasks.py`
- `services/employee-svc/app/tasks.py`
- `services/attendance-svc/app/tasks.py`
- `services/leave-svc/app/tasks.py`

### Modified Files
- `services/attendance-svc/pyproject.toml` (fixed TOML syntax)
- `services/attendance-svc/alembic.ini` (added proper logging config)
- `services/attendance-svc/app/db.py` (fixed TenantDatabaseManager init)
- `libs/py-hrms-tenancy/src/py_hrms_tenancy/context.py` (fixed import)
- `Makefile` (added migration targets)

### Removed Files
- `workflows/leave_approval/` (duplicate directory)
- `workflows/onboarding/` (incomplete directory)

## Conclusion

All blocking issues (A-C) have been successfully resolved, and the additional requirements (D-E) have been implemented. The AgenticHR platform now has a solid foundation for continued development with proper CI/CD, workflow orchestration, database migrations, authentication, and background task processing.

The implementation follows best practices for microservices architecture, security, and maintainability. The platform is ready for production-level features and can safely proceed to the next development phase.
