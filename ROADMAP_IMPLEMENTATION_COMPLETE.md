- **Database isolation** with automatic schema switching
- **Tenant-aware queries** and data access controls
- **Migration management** per tenant schema

### **Step 8: Agents Gateway** ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- **AI agents integration** with OpenAI and Anthropic APIs
- **Agent management** with configurable roles and capabilities
- **Rate limiting** and usage tracking per agent/user
- **Audit trails** for all AI operations and requests
- **Multi-model support** with provider abstraction

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### **Microservices (5 Services)**
1. **auth-svc** (Port 9001) - Authentication and user management
2. **employee-svc** (Port 9002) - Employee CRUD and management
3. **attendance-svc** (Port 9004) - Time tracking and attendance
4. **leave-svc** (Port 9005) - Leave management and approvals
5. **agents-gateway** (Port 9003) - AI agents and automation

### **Infrastructure Components**
- **Kong API Gateway** - Routing, CORS, and rate limiting
- **Keycloak** - Identity provider with MFA support
- **PostgreSQL** - Primary database with multi-tenant schemas
- **Redis** - Caching and session storage
- **RabbitMQ** - Message broker for Celery tasks
- **Temporal** - Workflow engine for business processes

### **Observability Stack**
- **Prometheus** - Metrics collection and alerting
- **Grafana** - Dashboards and visualization
- **Loki** - Log aggregation and search
- **OpenTelemetry** - Distributed tracing
- **OpenSearch** - Full-text search and analytics

### **Shared Libraries (3 Libraries)**
1. **py-hrms-auth** - Authentication, RBAC, and security
2. **py-hrms-observability** - Metrics, logging, tracing, health
3. **py-hrms-tenancy** - Multi-tenant context and database isolation
