# ADR-001: Microservices Architecture

## Status

Accepted

## Context

AgenticHR needs to be built as a scalable, maintainable HR management platform that can handle multiple tenants, integrate with various systems, and support AI agent automation. We need to decide on the overall architecture pattern.

## Decision

We will implement a **microservices architecture** with the following characteristics:

### Service Decomposition Strategy

Services are decomposed by **business domain** (Domain-Driven Design approach):

- **auth-svc**: Authentication and MFA
- **iam-gw**: Identity and Access Management
- **employee-svc**: Employee management
- **onboarding-svc**: Employee lifecycle workflows
- **attendance-svc**: Time and attendance tracking
- **leave-svc**: Leave management
- **timesheet-svc**: Time tracking and project management
- **payroll-svc**: Payroll processing
- **recruitment-svc**: Recruitment and hiring
- **compliance-svc**: Compliance and audit
- **docstore-svc**: Document storage and management
- **notify-svc**: Multi-channel notifications
- **search-svc**: Global search capabilities
- **analytics-svc**: Reporting and analytics
- **agents-gw**: AI agent integration

### Communication Patterns

- **Synchronous**: REST APIs via Kong API Gateway
- **Asynchronous**: Event-driven communication via NATS/Kafka
- **Workflows**: Temporal for long-running business processes

### Data Management

- **Database per Service**: Each service owns its data
- **Event Sourcing**: For audit trails and state reconstruction
- **CQRS**: Separate read/write models where appropriate

### Technology Stack

- **Framework**: FastAPI + Pydantic v2
- **Database**: PostgreSQL per service
- **Message Broker**: NATS JetStream / Apache Kafka
- **API Gateway**: Kong with declarative configuration
- **Service Mesh**: Optional Istio for production

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Scalability**: Services can be scaled independently
- **Technology Diversity**: Different services can use optimal technologies
- **Team Autonomy**: Teams can work independently on services
- **Fault Isolation**: Failure in one service doesn't bring down the system
- **Deployment Independence**: Services can be deployed separately
- **Domain Alignment**: Services align with business domains

### Negative

- **Complexity**: Distributed system complexity (network, monitoring, debugging)
- **Data Consistency**: Need to handle eventual consistency
- **Testing**: Integration testing becomes more complex
- **Operational Overhead**: More services to monitor and maintain
- **Network Latency**: Inter-service communication overhead

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Service Mesh**: Implement Istio for production to handle service-to-service communication
2. **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring with OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, and Grafana
3. **Circuit Breakers**: Implement circuit breaker pattern for resilience
4. **API Contracts**: Use OpenAPI specifications and contract testing
5. **Local Development**: Docker Compose for easy local development
6. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Reduce coupling through asynchronous events

## Alternatives Considered

### Monolithic Architecture

**Pros**: Simpler deployment, easier testing, no network overhead
**Cons**: Scaling limitations, technology lock-in, team coordination issues

**Rejected because**: AgenticHR needs to scale different components independently and support multiple development teams.

### Modular Monolith

**Pros**: Simpler than microservices, better than traditional monolith
**Cons**: Still has deployment coupling, harder to scale components independently

**Rejected because**: We need the flexibility to scale services independently and use different technologies where appropriate.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Services (Current)
- auth-svc
- employee-svc
- Basic infrastructure (Kong, Keycloak, PostgreSQL)

### Phase 2: HR Core
- leave-svc
- attendance-svc
- timesheet-svc

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- payroll-svc
- recruitment-svc
- onboarding-svc

### Phase 4: Intelligence & Analytics
- analytics-svc
- search-svc
- agents-gw

### Phase 5: Enterprise Features
- compliance-svc
- Advanced workflows
- Multi-region deployment
