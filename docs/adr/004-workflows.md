# ADR-004: Workflow Management Strategy

## Status

Proposed

## Context

AgenticHR requires robust workflow management for complex, long-running business processes that involve human interactions, external system integrations, and multi-step approvals. We need to choose a workflow orchestration approach that handles failures gracefully, provides visibility into process execution, and supports the reliability requirements of HR operations.

## Decision

Use **Temporal** for long-running orchestrations (onboarding, payroll processing, compliance workflows) with **Finite State Machine (FSM) fallback** for simple approval workflows.

### Primary Choice: Temporal

**Temporal** will handle complex workflows that require durability, retry logic, human task management, and long-term process visibility.

**FSM-based workflows** will be used for simpler approval processes that don't require the full complexity of Temporal's orchestration capabilities.

## Rationale

### Human Steps and Reliability

**HR workflows inherently involve human interactions** such as manager approvals, document reviews, and multi-step onboarding processes that can span days or weeks.

**Retry and failure handling** are critical for HR processes where failures can impact employee experience, compliance, and business operations.

**Process visibility and auditing** are essential for HR compliance, debugging workflow issues, and providing status updates to stakeholders.

### Temporal Advantages

**Durable Execution**: Workflows survive service restarts, deployments, and infrastructure failures without losing state.

**Built-in Retry Logic**: Configurable retry policies for different types of failures, with exponential backoff and circuit breaker patterns.

**Human Task Management**: Native support for workflows that wait for human input with configurable timeouts and escalation.

**Observability**: Rich monitoring, tracing, and debugging capabilities for workflow execution and performance analysis.

## Alternatives Considered

### Custom Workflow Engine
**Pros**: Full control over implementation, tailored to specific needs
**Cons**: High development and maintenance overhead, reinventing complex orchestration patterns

### Apache Airflow
**Pros**: Mature workflow orchestration, good for data pipelines
**Cons**: Primarily designed for batch processing, not ideal for event-driven business workflows

### AWS Step Functions / Azure Logic Apps
**Pros**: Fully managed, serverless scaling, cloud-native integrations
**Cons**: Vendor lock-in, limited local development, higher costs for complex workflows

### Database-based State Machines
**Pros**: Simple implementation, familiar technology stack
**Cons**: Limited retry capabilities, poor observability, difficult to handle complex orchestration

## Consequences

### Positive

**Reliability for Business Processes**: Temporal's durability guarantees ensure critical HR processes complete successfully even during system failures.

**Developer Productivity**: Rich SDK and tooling reduce the complexity of implementing complex workflow logic.

**Operational Visibility**: Built-in monitoring and debugging capabilities provide insights into workflow performance and failures.

**Scalability**: Temporal can handle thousands of concurrent workflows with automatic scaling and load balancing.

**Compliance Support**: Detailed audit trails and process history support HR compliance and regulatory requirements.

### Negative

**Infrastructure Complexity**: Additional infrastructure component to deploy, monitor, and maintain.

**Learning Curve**: Team needs to learn Temporal concepts, patterns, and best practices.

**Resource Overhead**: Temporal cluster requires dedicated resources and operational expertise.

**Overkill for Simple Cases**: Simple approval workflows may not need Temporal's full capabilities.

### Mitigation Strategies

**Hybrid Approach**: Use FSM for simple workflows and Temporal for complex orchestrations to optimize resource usage.

**Training and Documentation**: Invest in team training and create clear guidelines for when to use each approach.

**Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive monitoring for Temporal cluster health and workflow performance.

**Gradual Adoption**: Start with a few critical workflows and gradually migrate more processes to Temporal.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Temporal Foundation
- Set up Temporal cluster in development and production environments
- Implement basic workflow patterns and shared libraries
- Create monitoring and alerting for Temporal operations

### Phase 2: Core HR Workflows
- Employee onboarding workflow with multi-step approvals
- Leave request approval workflow with manager and HR steps
- Payroll processing workflow with validation and approval gates

### Phase 3: Advanced Orchestrations
- Employee offboarding with system access revocation
- Performance review cycles with multiple participants
- Compliance audit workflows with document collection

### Phase 4: Integration and Optimization
- Integration with external HRIS systems
- Workflow analytics and performance optimization
- Advanced retry and error handling patterns

## Workflow Categories

### Long-running Orchestrations (Temporal)

**Employee Onboarding**: Multi-day process involving document collection, system provisioning, training scheduling, and manager check-ins.

**Payroll Processing**: Monthly process with data validation, approval workflows, payment processing, and reconciliation steps.

**Compliance Audits**: Quarterly or annual processes involving data collection, review cycles, and report generation.

**Performance Reviews**: Annual cycles with self-assessments, manager reviews, calibration meetings, and goal setting.

### Simple Approvals (FSM)

**Leave Requests**: Basic approval workflow with manager approval and HR notification.

**Expense Reports**: Simple approval chain with spending limit validation.

**Time-off Adjustments**: Quick approval process for schedule changes.

**Document Approvals**: Simple review and approval for policy documents.

## Workflow Design Principles

### Idempotency
All workflow activities must be idempotent to handle retries and ensure consistent outcomes.

### Compensation
Implement compensation logic for workflows that need to undo previous steps in case of failures.

### Timeouts
Configure appropriate timeouts for human tasks and external system interactions.

### Monitoring
Include comprehensive logging and metrics for workflow execution and performance analysis.

## Monitoring and Evaluation

**Workflow Success Rates**: Track completion rates and failure patterns across different workflow types.

**Performance Metrics**: Monitor workflow execution times, retry rates, and resource utilization.

**Human Task Metrics**: Track time spent on human tasks, escalation rates, and approval patterns.

**System Health**: Monitor Temporal cluster performance, resource usage, and availability.

**Business Impact**: Measure workflow efficiency improvements and their impact on HR operations.
