# AgenticHR Full Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the comprehensive work performed to address critical issues and implement the remaining features (Tasks F-J) for the AgenticHR microservices platform.

## 1. Critical Issue Resolution (Phases 1-3)

*   **Redis Connection Errors**: Standardized Celery Redis backend configuration to `redis://redis:6379/0` across `auth-svc` and `employee-svc` for consistent connectivity.
*   **Import Path Problems**: Addressed by modifying `pyproject.toml` files to correctly reference the `py-hrms-auth` library as a local dependency. Dockerfiles were updated to use Poetry for dependency management.
*   **Missing Celery Tasks**: Confirmed that Celery tasks are correctly defined and invoked within `auth-svc` and `employee-svc`. New tasks were added for `attendance-svc` and `leave-svc`.
*   **Middleware Imports**: Ensured `AuthN` and `SecurityHeadersMiddleware` are correctly imported and applied to `auth-svc`, `employee-svc`, `attendance-svc`, and `leave-svc`.
*   **Relationship Definitions**: Verified that `employee-svc`, `attendance-svc`, and `leave-svc` have properly defined SQLAlchemy models and database initialization.

## 2. Feature Implementation (Phases 4-6)

*   **Attendance Service (`attendance-svc`)**: Scaffolding completed with `pyproject.toml`, `db.py`, `models.py`, and `main.py`. Includes database models for shifts and attendance records, along with endpoints for managing these. Integrated with `py-hrms-auth` for authentication.
*   **Leave Management Service (`leave-svc`)**: Scaffolding completed with `pyproject.toml`, `db.py`, `models.py`, and `main.py`. Includes database models for leave types, balances, and requests, along with endpoints for managing these. Integrated with `py-hrms-auth` for authentication and includes Celery tasks for approval workflows and balance updates.
*   **Infrastructure Updates**: `docker/compose.dev.yml` was updated to include `attendance-svc` and `leave-svc` as application services and their respective Celery workers. `docker/kong/kong.yml` was updated to include service and route definitions for `attendance-svc` and `leave-svc`.

## 3. Remaining Tasks (F-J) Implementation (Phases 7-11)

### Task F: Temporal Workflows for Leave Approval and Onboarding
*   **Workflow Definitions**: `workflows/leave_approval/workflow.py` and `workflows/onboarding/workflow.py` define the Temporal workflows for managing leave requests and employee onboarding processes.
*   **Activities**: `workflows/shared/activities.py` contains shared activities for interacting with other services (e.g., sending notifications, calling service APIs, updating records).
*   **Worker Setup**: `workflows/worker.py` is implemented to run the Temporal worker, registering the defined workflows and activities.
*   **Docker Integration**: `workflows/Dockerfile` and `docker/compose.dev.yml` were updated to include the `workflow-worker` service and its dependencies.

### Task G: Security Hardening with Router-Level Auth and Audit Logs
*   **RBAC Integration**: Applied `require_permission` and `require_resource_access` decorators to API endpoints in `auth-svc`, `employee-svc`, `attendance-svc`, and `leave-svc` to enforce fine-grained access control.
*   **Audit Logging**: Implemented `AuditLogORM` model in `py-hrms-observability/src/py_hrms_observability/audit_log.py` and a dedicated `db.py` for audit log persistence. An `AuditLogMiddleware` was created and integrated into all services to automatically log API requests and responses.

### Task H: Observability with OpenTelemetry and Dashboards
*   **Integrated Observability Components**: `LoggingMiddleware`, `MetricsMiddleware`, and `configure_tracing` from `py-hrms-observability` were integrated into all services (`auth-svc`, `employee-svc`, `attendance-svc`, `leave-svc`, `agents-gateway`).
*   **Metrics Exposure**: A `/metrics` endpoint was added to each service to expose Prometheus metrics.
*   **Lifespan Initialization**: `lifespan` functions in each service were updated to initialize logging and tracing at application startup.

### Task I: Multi-tenancy with Schema-per-Tenant Enforcement
*   **`TenantMiddleware` Integration**: Applied `TenantMiddleware` to all services to establish tenant context for each request.
*   **Database Multi-tenancy**: Modified `db.py` files in all services to use `TenantDatabaseManager` for dynamic schema selection based on tenant ID, ensuring data isolation.
*   **Authentication Context**: Updated `py-hrms-auth/src/py_hrms_auth/jwt_dep.py` to set the tenant context from the JWT token upon authentication.
*   **Environment Variables**: Added `DEFAULT_TENANT_ID` to service configurations in `docker/compose.dev.yml`.

### Task J: Complete Agents Gateway with AI Integration
*   **Database Models**: Leveraged existing `AgentORM`, `ModelProviderORM`, `AgentRequestORM`, `AgentUsageORM`, `AgentAuditORM`, and `AgentRateLimitORM` models in `services/agents-gateway/app/models.py`.
*   **Database Configuration**: Created `services/agents-gateway/app/db.py` for multi-tenancy database management.
*   **Refactored `AgentService`**: Updated `AgentService` in `services/agents-gateway/app/main.py` to use database models for agent management, including CRUD operations, rate limiting, and usage logging.
*   **CRUD Endpoints**: Implemented API endpoints for managing agent configurations (`/v1/agents`) with RBAC.
*   **AI Integration**: Enhanced the `chat_with_agent` endpoint to use database-managed agent configurations and log interactions.
*   **Environment Variables**: Added `DEFAULT_TENANT_ID`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to `agents-gateway` service configuration in `docker/compose.dev.yml`.
