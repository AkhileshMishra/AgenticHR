# AgenticHR Microservices Platform - Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the work performed to address critical issues and implement initial features for the AgenticHR microservices platform. The primary goal was to ensure all components are functional and the system works end-to-end, laying the groundwork for production readiness.

## 1. Critical Issue Resolution

The following critical issues identified in the initial setup have been addressed:

*   **Redis Connection Errors**: Standardized Celery Redis backend configuration to `redis://redis:6379/0` across `auth-svc` and `employee-svc` to ensure consistent and correct connectivity for background tasks.
*   **Import Path Problems**: The `py-hrms-auth` library was properly integrated by updating `pyproject.toml` files in `auth-svc`, `employee-svc`, `attendance-svc`, and `leave-svc` to reference it as a local dependency. Dockerfiles were also updated to leverage Poetry for dependency management, aiming to resolve any potential import issues within the containerized environment.
*   **Missing Celery Tasks**: Celery tasks were confirmed to be correctly defined and invoked within `auth-svc` (e.g., `send_login_notification`, `cleanup_expired_sessions`) and `employee-svc` (e.g., `send_welcome_email`, `reindex_employee`). New, placeholder tasks were also added for `attendance-svc` and `leave-svc`.
*   **Middleware Imports**: The `AuthN` authentication middleware and `SecurityHeadersMiddleware` were correctly imported and applied to `auth-svc`, `employee-svc`, `attendance-svc`, and `leave-svc` to ensure proper security and authentication across services.
*   **Relationship Definitions**: The SQLAlchemy models and database initialization (`db.py` and `models.py`) for `employee-svc`, `attendance-svc`, and `leave-svc` were reviewed and confirmed to be structurally sound, ensuring correct data relationships.

## 2. Feature Implementation: People Ops Slice (Attendance and Leave Services)

Two new core services for People Operations were scaffolded and integrated:

*   **Attendance Service (`attendance-svc`)**:
    *   **Purpose**: Manages employee check-ins, check-outs, and shift tracking.
    *   **Components**: Includes `pyproject.toml` for dependencies, `db.py` for database configuration, `models.py` for `ShiftORM` and `AttendanceSummaryORM` database schemas, and `main.py` with basic check-in/check-out endpoints. It also includes placeholder Celery tasks for notifications and summary updates.
    *   **Integration**: Fully integrated with `py-hrms-auth` for authentication and authorization.

*   **Leave Service (`leave-svc`)**:
    *   **Purpose**: Manages leave requests, approvals, and balance tracking.
    *   **Components**: Includes `pyproject.toml` for dependencies, `db.py` for database configuration, `models.py` for `LeaveTypeORM`, `LeaveBalanceORM`, and `LeaveRequestORM` database schemas, and `main.py` with endpoints for managing leave types, requests, and balances. It also includes placeholder Celery tasks for approval workflows and balance updates.
    *   **Integration**: Fully integrated with `py-hrms-auth` for authentication and authorization.

## 3. Infrastructure Updates

Key infrastructure components were updated to support the new services and ensure proper communication:

*   **Docker Compose (`docker/compose.dev.yml`)**:
    *   Added service definitions for `attendance-svc` and `leave-svc`.
    *   Added Celery worker definitions for `attendance-worker` and `leave-worker`.
    *   Ensured consistent environment variables for `REDIS_URL`, `RABBITMQ_URL`, `OIDC_ISSUER`, `JWKS_URL`, and `OIDC_AUDIENCE` across all relevant services and workers.
    *   Updated build contexts and Dockerfile paths for services and workers to correctly reference the monorepo structure.

*   **Kong Gateway (`docker/kong/kong.yml`)**:
    *   Added service and route definitions for `attendance-svc` and `leave-svc` to allow external access and routing through the API gateway.

## 5. Limitations

It is important to note that due to a persistent `iptables` error encountered during Docker image builds within the sandbox environment, live end-to-end testing of the Dockerized services was not possible. All validations for the implemented fixes and new features were conducted through thorough code review and analysis of the provided context. The code changes are logically sound and adhere to the intended architectural design, but their runtime behavior in a fully deployed Docker environment could not be verified within this session.
